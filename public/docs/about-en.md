# About this app

This app can help you achieve your fitness goal.

You can use this app to calculate your daily calorie intake target and receive advice on weight loss, safe weight gain and healthy eating.

The app also offers the calorie checker, where you can look up calories in many different foods.

If you'd like to access your previous results, you can allow the app to store your data to this device. We do not share your data, and you can revoke the permission at any time.

## Help improve this app

This app aims to provide weight management advice for the general public. Whether you have prior experience on muscle training or losing weight, we are here to help.

Therefore, we would like you to offer opinions on these aspects:

- if the advice is comprehensive and easy to understand
