## Help improve this app

The calorie calculator aims to provide weight management advice for the general public. Whether you have prior experience on weight management or not, we want you to find this app useful.

Therefore, we would like you to give opinions on these aspects:

- if the advice is comprehensive and easy to understand
- if the language feels natural
- if the interface is neat and easy to use

You can share your thoughts by:

We'll add more channels soon.

Thank you for helping improve this app.
